# DiscordBot
My first project yay :DDDDDDDD

SET UP NOTE (sorry for yelling):
This is for whoever wants to also create their own bot that can respond back using GPT 3.5.

Download all the files and open them using an IDE.

Obtain a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal (search it up)<br>
Get an OpenAI API key (you have to make an account)<br>

(add those into the TokenAndKey.env file)

Don't forget to pip install dotenv, discord, and openai modules.
