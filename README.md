# DiscordBot
My first project yay :DDDDDDDD

SET UP NOTE (sorry for yelling):
This is for whoever wants to also create their own bot that can respond back using openAI API.

Obtain a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal (search it up)<br>
Get an OpenAI API key (you have to make an account)<br>
(Export them in terminal to store locally, do not share these with anyone else)
