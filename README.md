# DiscordBot
My first project yay :D

SET UP NOTE (sorry for yelling):<br>
This is for whoever wants to also create their own bot that can respond back using GPT 3.5.

Download all the files and open them using an IDE. (I used vscode)

Obtain a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal (search it up)<br>
Pay 5 bucks for credits to send requests to use the OpenAI API, otherwise you will receive ErrorCode 429: You exceeded your current quota. <br>
Be sure to generate a new API key after paying and update it in the env file.

If you somehow receive a free trial for the API then you do not need to pay.

(add those into the TokenAndKey.env file)

Don't forget to pip install dotenv, discord, and openai modules.
